<p>The fourth stage of life is preferred by many people along this path, and it is the stage where the human being begins to discover himself.

Sentimental life is strong in this phase, experiencing new feelings (positive and negative) of those who previously lacked.

The attraction for the opposite sex takes an important part in this stage of the hand of the development of the sexual glands.

As for the end of this stage, although it can be considered to take place at twenty years of age, it depends a lot on each individual and the environment where it has developed, for example:

- Lifestyle : in rural societies, this stage concludes earlier than in those inhabiting cosmopolitan cities.

- Gender : usually, women reach maturity (own stage 5, youth) earlier than men.</p>
