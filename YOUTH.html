<p>At this stage, the human being is more calm with himself, has his values ​​more defined and begins to project towards the future:

-Independence of the parents.

-Stay sentiment stable.

-Economic stability.

At this stage the human being leaves behind the fantasy of previous years and begins to interact more with reality.

It begins to take on responsibilities and commitments that will then harden into the next stage: adulthood.</p>
