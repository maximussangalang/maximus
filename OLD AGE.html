<p>Seventh and last stage of human life. This stage is reached at the age of sixty years and will be the stage that accompanies the human being until the end of his days.

The main characteristic of this stage is the physical deterioration suffered by the organism produced over the years, as well as intellectual and sensorial capacity.

It is worth clarifying that the extent to which the health of the individual is affected will depend on his actions in the past.

Material things are no longer part of their priorities, they have lost all interest in them. Live the present as it is, and no longer project to the future, because your life is already done.

His priorities now go to enjoy with loved ones who accompanied him in the years of the past. In this final stage, the past is what is most missed.</p>
