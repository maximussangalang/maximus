<p>The stages of human life are the seven steps that are experienced throughout the life cycle. During that time, the individual learns from the surrounding environment and experiences all kinds of physical and emotional changes.

Although life expectancy was not always the same throughout history, people who died in old age also transitioned the epatas of the life of the human being that transited today. 
In fact, the time it takes to move from one stage to another is relative in the intermediate stages, and depends on the conditions in which each individual lives (for example, the social factor).

The learning and intellect of the person, in its early stages of life, develops with much more intensity, and decays in the course of the same.

The same happens with the physical and healthy development of the person, although in the first ten years of life, the human body is still vulnerable.

On the other hand, emotional stability has just begun to consolidate beyond the age of twenty-five. Before that, the psychological aspect is very variable.</p>
