<p>After leaving the womb, the human being begins with the second stage of life: the stage of childhood.

These are the first years of the human being in the outer world, and although he sleeps most of the time, his mind captures absolutely everything from the surrounding environment.

During this stage, you learn to walk, manipulate objects with your hands, make sounds and talk. Feel very curious.

The stage of infancy culminates at the age of six years after birth.</p>
